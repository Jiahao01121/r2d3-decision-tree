# Clone of [R2D3](http://www.r2d3.us) decision tree

[See Demo](https://yamad.github.io/r2d3-decision-tree/)

There is a beautiful animation of data flowing through a decision tree at [R2D3: A Visual Guide to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us). This is a clone to learn about how that animation was made.

Made with: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), [D3](https://d3js.org), and [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) (as an exercise).
